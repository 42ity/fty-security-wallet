         /usr/share/componentname/... and be installed/merged with an
         ipc-meta-setup scriptlet during first boot with that version.
         This would avoid conflicts between newer delivered versions
         overlaid by locally customized older copy. Currently however,
         this file is not intended to be edited in production instances.
