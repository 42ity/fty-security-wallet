## Architecture

### Overview

fty-security-wallet is composed of 1 actor :

* CREATE : create (a list of) new documents in the default portfolio security wallet
* DELETE : remove an existing document

* UPDATE_SECRET : update all except secw_doc_type and secw_doc_id
* GET_WITHOUT_SECRET : return public part of Document 
* GET_WITH_SECRET : return public and private part of Document

The USER peer  sends the following messages using MAILBOX SEND to
"security-wallet" peer :

* REQUEST __COMMAND__/'msg-correlation-id'

where
* subject should be REQUEST
* '/' indicates a multipart string message
* __COMMAND__ available are CREATE, DELETE, UPDATE_WITHOUT_SECRET
* 'msg-correlation-id' MUST be unique identifier of the message

```bash
bmsg request security-wallet REQUEST GET_DUMMY_WITH_SECRET 1234 default
