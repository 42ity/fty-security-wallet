## Architecture

### Overview

fty-security-wallet is composed of 1 agent and 1 client library :

* SecurityWalletServer registers to malamute broker as security-wallet agent 
  and handles mailbox requests

* ClientAccessor registers to malamute broker using a client id (agent name) and then
  can execute request to the SecurityWalletServer

* SecurityWalletServer need a database file for the data (database.json) and a
  configuration file for the management of access (access.json)

* C++ Namespace for this project is "secw"

### Data structure organization

The Security wallet is use to store "Document".
A document has:
* 1 header (id, type, name and list of tag)
* 1 public part
* 1 private part (secret)

A document should always have at least one "tag"

Each document are stored in a "Portfolio".

The SecurityWalletServer has a list of portfolio available.

### Access control

Access are define in the for tag using:
* A regex which need to match with the client id (agent name)
* An access list "CRUD" where
* * C allow user to create a new document containing this tag
* * R read the private part of any document with this tag
* * U update the content of any document with this tag
* * D remove a document with this tag or remove a tag from a document

### Mailbox protocol

* Message subject "REQUEST"
* Frame 1: Correlation id
* Frame 2: Command
* frame 3-n : Parameters for the command

Normal Reply
* Message subject "REPLY"
* Frame 1: Correlation id
* Frame 2: Data in Json format or "OK" if no data where needed

* Frame 1: Correlation id
* Frame 2: "ERROR"
* Frame 3: Error description in Json if the error belong to SecwException
